abstract ={Motivation: In model organisms such as yeast, large
databases of  protein‚Äìprotein and protein-DNA interactions have
become an extremely  important resource for the study of protein
function, evolution, and gene  regulatory dynamics. In this
paper we demonstrate that by integrating these  interactions
with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to 
generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms
governing the  observed changes in gene expression. To perform
this integration  systematically and at large scale, we
introduce an approach for screening a  molecular interaction
network to identify active subnetworks, i.e.,  connected 
regions of the network that show significant changes in
expression over  particular subsets of conditions. The method we
present here combines a  rigorous statistical measure for
scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm  for identifying
subnetworks with high score.Results: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362
interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 
protein‚Äìprotein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public
databases.  In the case of the small network, we identified five
significant subnetworks  that covered 41 out of 77 (53%) of all
significant changes in expression.  Both network analyses returned
several top-scoring subnetworks with good  correspondence to known
regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These  results demonstrate
how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to  uncover signalling
and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative  fashion.Availability: The methods presented in this paper are
implemented  in the Cytoscape software package which is
available to the academic community at  http://www.cytoscape.org.Contact: trey@wi.mit.eduKeywords: molecular interactions; gene expression; data integration; simulated

abstract ={Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).Contact: mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},
